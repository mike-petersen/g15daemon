    This daemon listens on localhost port 15550 for client connections,
    and arbitrates LCD display.  Allows for multiple simultaneous clients.
    Client screens can be cycled through by pressing the 'L1' key.
*/

Version 1.0-pre0
- Initial release
1.1 21/07/2006
- Add WBMP support and Perl bindings.
1.2 31/07/2006
** IMPORTANT NOTE **
This release has changed the LCD screen switch function to the MR key to
allow clients use of all 'L' keys.
**
- reduce per-thread stack usage - default was 8Mb on i386 linux.  now 256k
  this makes top output look much nicer ;)
- optimize lcd buffer path, removing a conversion step. and reducing the
  buffer size from 7k to 1k
- misc other memory optimisations.
- added python bindings (thanks muhgatus)
- added ability for lcd clients to receive L G & M key keypresses directly
- moved lcd display/client switch from L1 to MR
- MR key is now backlit when clients are attached.
- Added ability for lcd clients to change backlight brightness
- Added ability for lcd clients to toggle M-key LEDs
- Added libG15Render client support.
- Added ability for hidden lcd clients to bring themselves to the foreground
- clients change only their own backlight/mkey led status
1.2.1 06/08/2006
- Fix bug which could cause client screens to be lost under certain circumstances.
1.2.2 28/10/2006
- Vastly improve latency issues when using 'G' keys
- Documentation updates
- includes xkb patch for xorg 7.1 for native g15 keyboard layout in X11 (contrib directory)
1.2.3 30/10/2006
- improved the Xmodmaprc configuration, it now has parity with the xkb version
1.2.4 01/11/2006
- Users can now choose to use the L1 key to switch between client screens instead of MR. 
  - L1 is the small round black button directly below the LCD.
  - Use -s on the commandline to activate the change.
1.2.5 05/11/2006
- Add ability for clients to request all M and G keypresses be 'pushed' to them,
  rather than having to request them repeatedly.  If a client uses this
  option, no keyboard processing is done by the daemon, and the client must
  be prepared to do uinput processing itself, if necessary.  This limitation
  may be removed in future versions of the API.  Normal processing will
  resume when the client that requested this feature exits or closes its
  connection.
- Add manpage for the daemon.
- Fix automake bug that caused documentation not to be installed by default.
- Fix the daemons cmdline processing to handle more than one commandline option.
- Refactored the code slightly to allow for easier modification in the future.
- Handle long commandline arguments such as --help --version --kill --switch.
- Greatly improve error reporting.
- Add client development documentation (man g15daemon_client_devel / README.client_devel)
- Added a 'debug' mode (-d or --debug) cmdline switch to keep the daemon in the foreground
  rather than daemonising.  All errors and other info will be reported to STDERR in this mode.
- If compiled with libg15 1.1.0 or greater (or svn versions later than 3/11/06), the daemon 
  will now reset the keyboard to defaults on exit.
- make distcheck && make dist now work as expected.
- libg15daemon_client is now slightly more useful
- debian packaging now installs manpages
1.2.5svn -> current
- Add compiletime check for uinput version, should resolve compilation problems on some distro's
- Security improved - the daemon now sets its effective uid to nobody as soon as possible.
1.9.0
- Feature: Add plugin API
- Feature: partially rewritten event core 
- Feature: updated g15daemon_xmms_spectrum plugin with new features, available in trunk/g15daemon_audio_plugins (SVN)
- Feature: Clock is now a plugin
- Feature: dependency on libdaemon is now removed
- Feature: g15daemon is now dependant on libg15render.
- Feature: Clock now includes analog clock thanks to Rasta Freak <igor.jusic@zg.t-com.hr>
- Moved g15daemon_xmms_spectrum plugin to separate package
1.9.1
- BugFix: Plugins are now installed in ${PREFIX}/{${LIBDIR}/g15daemon/${VERSION}/plugins
- Feature: OS-X support thanks to Fabrizio Sestito.
- Bugfix: libg15daemon_client: keypresses were being corrupted.
- Bugfix: libg15daemon_client: use g15_recv rather than recv.
- Bugfix: use default scheduling for all threads.
- Optimisation: minor optimisation of lcd_cycle() code.
- Security: repair some potential security holes.
- Bugfix: Backlight status was being mis-applied when cycling screens.
- Bugfix: Language bindings were not being distributed.
1.9.2
- BugFix: Add exitfunc to net plugin for exit notification.
- BugFix: Use pause() instead of sleeping
- BugFix: create leaving var as volatile.
- BugFix: Add NAME section to g15daemon_client manpages
- Tweak delay between successive keyboard reads.  This reduces cpu load by
  50% on my system.
- Bugfix: Ensure that all plugin exit functions are called on leaving.
- Bugfix: if keypress event is received (very early in the startup process,
  the daemon would crash.  Check that expected pointers are valid.
- Bugfix: Dont attempt compilation of uinput plugin if headers are
  unavailable.
- Bugfix: Write a blank buffer to the LCD before exiting.
- Feature: Add --lcdlevel cmdline option to allow setting default LCD brightness level
1.9.3:
- BugFix: The documentation for --switch was inverted. Fix.
- Debug: Print list of commandline args when in debug mode
- BugFix: The decreased delay caused keypresses to be misread on some
  machines.  REVERT.
1.9.3->SVN:
- Debug:   Log warning if keyboard disappears.
- Bugfix:  Fix autoconf autodetect bugs re uinput plugin.
- Feature: If autodetection of uinput fails, configure now has a
           --disable-uinput override.  
- Feature: WIP should now compile and run on Linux, MacOSX, and Solaris (v10+).
	   Only Linux and Solaris have been tested.
- Debug:   Add more debugging to plugin loader.
- Debug:   Log build date,OS and GCC version.
- Feature: Plugin loader will now use DEEP_BIND if available, hopefully
	   resolving conflicts on OS's that support it.
- Feature: Solaris support.  Requires some end-user changes to the usb
	   stack at the moment.  Documentation coming soon.
- BugFix:  Plugin loader is now much more robust.
- Feature: Add OS specific documentation for Linux and FreeBSD.
	   Compilation and use on FreeBSD is completely untested.
- Feature: Debug verbosity of g15daemon_log is now variable.
- Feature: Plugin filenames are now cached in g15daemon.conf to allow
	   (manual, at this stage) changing of load-order.
