*** Please Note: G15Daemon is completely untested on FreeBSD.

In order for G15Daemon to be able to claim the usb device needed for the LCD and extra keys, 
the following _kernel_ configuration changes may be necessary:

First test if ugen is already enabled:
	- Plug in the keyboard or other supported USB device.
	- dmesg |grep "ugen"
	- you should see a line similar to "ugen0: Logitech G15 Keyboard"

If not already enabled:

   For FreeBSD versions 5.4 and below, and version 6.0:
	Disable uhid
	Enable ugen

   For FreeBSD versions 5.5, 6.1 and higher:
	Enable ugen

   Recompile the kernel and reboot.

NetBSD and OpenBSD are not supported at this time due to libusb deficiencies on those platforms.
