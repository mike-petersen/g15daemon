TODO list for G15daemon.  Not in any particular order.
********************************************************************************

- Read a configuration file.  Currently there are no real user-configurable
options, but ....

- Allow for clients to change LCD backlight.

- enable the M-key backlights - the library supports this

- write a small client app to set configuration options on-the-fly (M-key
toggle, backlight, etc)

- Allow for clients to request sole use of the 'L' keys (perhaps passing
their status back to the client via MSGs on the socket.

- Allow for clients to send text-based commands controlling the output (need
interpreter for this)

- Allow for clients to set a time-to-live for screens they create, which
will allow the client app to exit without taking the screen with them. 

- Clients using the above functionality ought to be able to re-connect and
use the 'screen' they previously created, as long as they return within the
'time-to-live' period they set before exiting. This will allow for scripts
etc to periodically update.
