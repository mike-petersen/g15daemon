G15daemon takes control of the G15 keyboard, allowing the use of all keys 
through the linux kernel uinput device driver.  It also controls the use 
of the keyboard's LCD display, allows multiple, simultaneous client applications 
to connect, and gives the user the ability to switch between client apps 
at the press of a button.

Currently, patches to enable support for the daemon are available for 
libgraphlcd, which in turn enables support for lcdproc, vdr, and any 
other applications able to use that library.  A simple xmms spectrum analyser plugin, 
based on the finespectrum plugin, is also available in the package.

G15daemon depends on libg15 from G15tools, and the libdaemon development packages
 from your distrobution, or from the libdaemon homepage.

Whilst G15daemon is developed on and for linux, chances are that it will 
compile and run on any OS that supports pthreads, libusb, and libdaemon.

[INSTALLING]

To install, enter the directory you've extracted the archive into, and type:

./configure 
make
make install

[RUNNING THE DAEMON]

to run :
g15daemon

to kill a previously running daemon :
g15daemon -k

[USING THE EXTRA KEYS]

*** Please Note ***

   As of version 1.2, the MR key is used for switching between LCD clients,
	and cannot be used for other purposes if the LCD is being used.

***

For a number of reasons, by default the keys on the G15 arent usable -
especially without g15daemon :)  With g15daemon running, the kernel will
know all about the new keys, but your 'X' server won't without a bit of help.
In the contrib subfolder of the g15daemon distrobution, you'll find an xmodmaprc
script.  To have all those new keys working in X11, you'll need to have
xmodmap read that file on every startup.  Depending on your distro, xmodmap
may automatically load the file if it is copied to ${HOME}/.Xmodmap
otherwise you will have to load it yourself.  There is an example xmodmap.sh
file in the contrib directory that will do this, if it's placed (for
instance) in kde's Autostart folder.

[USING THE LCD]

Patches are available for libgraphlcd, in the g15daemon patches
subdirectory.  You'll need a copy of graphlcd source, which is available
from http://graphlcd.berlios.de . The patches are against the current
version, which is 1.3.

To patch the graphlcd source, extract the graphlcd-base archive, then type:
patch -p0 -i "g15daemon_src_folder"/patches/graphlcd-1.3_g15daemon_drv.patch

where 'g15daemon_src_folder' is the directory you extracted the g15daemon
sourcecode into...
